* Introduction
  In [[file:new-carbon-x1-manjaro.org][late 2019 I got a new thinkpad]]. In that post I wrote about
installing Manjaro linux. In retrospect I think it went just ok - I
had some pain with the architect installer and some key system
features weren't working right. After that I tried Ubuntu and then
Fedora. They worked well enough but I wasn't totally satisfied.

The other day I was inspired to install Arch.  I downloaded the iso,
ran ~dd~, and rebooted. Once the boot media loaded I ran [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall][archinstall]] -
a new addition to arch that does a basic installation
automatically. ~archinstall~ ran without problems, and overall was
easier than going through the Manjaro Architect installer. I didn't
install a profile so I was left with a barebones system.

In general you should follow advice from the Arch Wiki, not from blog
posts like this. Here's a good place to start:

[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)]] 
* Setup
** Bios
Change the "Sleep State" to "Windows".  I've had it on "Linux"
for the last year and have had problems with waking. This
fixes it.
** Linux Console
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Linux_console#Persistent_configuration

The text in the TTY was tiny after the installation. Here's how I
increased the font size:
1. ~pacman -S terminus-font~
2. Update [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/linux-console][/etc/vconsole.conf]]
** SMBus Errors
 After booting I was getting errors in the console like ~i801_smbus
 timeout~. To fix this [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/boot-arch][I blacklisted]] the ~i2c_i801~ kernel module.
** i3 WM
Here is how I setup my i3 environment. I'm definitely missing quite a
few things, so check the arch wiki when in doubt.

i3 config: https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/i3

*** pacman -S
+ ~xorg-server i3-gaps dmenu i3status lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
  pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa firefox gnome-terminal~
+ ~feh~ set a background picture
+ ~nm-applet~ configure network from tray
+ ~pasystray~ configure audio volume and output from tray
+ ~scrot~ screenshot tool
*** X Config
+ Initiaize X: [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/xinitrc][~/.xinitrc]]
+ Increase DPI: [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/xresources][~/.Xresources]] 
+ Set a background in lightdm: [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/lightdm-gtk-greeter][/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf]] 
*** Scripts
Scripts I wrote that I bind in my i3 config. I store these
locally in ~~/bin/~ (added to ~$PATH~ in my [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/profile][profile]]).

+ Bind [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/toggle-display][toggle-display]] to the display media key (~XF86Display~). It
  switches my display to an external monitor if it's plugged in, or
  back to my laptop screen.
+ Bind [[https://dotfilehub.com/knoebber/screenshot][screenshot]] to the PrtSc key (~code: 107~).  Saves a screenshot
  to ~~/Pictures/screenshots~.
* Conclusion
Everything is working better than expected. Webcam, microphone and
media keys work. I've been enjoying the simplicity and documentation
of Arch. Setting it up has been fun and problems feel
solvable. Hopefully my distrohopping is over for now!
