I recently got a new laptop:

+ Model: 20qd001uus
+ Ram: 16 gb
+ CPU: Intel Core i5-8265U
+ Screen: 2560x1440
+ Disk: 500gb SSD

I debated what to install on it for a while. I run Arch on my desktop
PC, and in the past have ran Ubuntu on my laptops.  I find pacman
easier to use than apt, but I like the ease of installation and device
support with Ubuntu.

For a laptop this is specifically important. I don't enjoy configuring
media keys, or finding why closing the lid doesn't make the machine
sleep.  I also don't have the patience to configure system themes.

I chose Manjaro because it's based on Arch and claims to be user
friendly.  Here are some [[https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro:_A_Different_Kind_of_Beast][differences between Arch and Manjaro]].

**Installing**

I downloaded the [[https://www.manjaro.org/download/official/architect/][Manjaro Architect disc image]].  It took me a while to
figure out how to get the flash drive to boot. Eventually I went into
windows and did system recovery which finally gave me access to the
bios.

The live media OS is impressive. It walks you through the installation
process in a CLI. You don't need to type bash commands like you would
in an Arch install (manual gparted commands are scary!). I chose
minimal desktop installation with i3.  Be careful as there are lots of
menus to go through. I recommend having another computer available
with an installation guide open.

Make sure to check mirror speeds before starting the package
installation, I didn't do this my first try and it went /really/
slow. So much that I started over again.

My second try everything worked except that it wouldn't boot due to a
mistake with systemd-boot.  Luckily I was able to fix it with the live
media.

Tips on fixing an installation from the Manjaro Architect live
environment:

After logging in do ~$ setup~. This lets you easily configure an
internet connection.  Exit the installer after configuring the
network.

Now mount the installed system. Use ~# manjaro-chroot -a~ instead of
~# mount /dev/xxx /mnt && chroot /mnt /bin/bash~.  This will keep your
internet connection and devices working properly.  Now you can install
or fix packages.

**The Good**

- Graphical login screen
- i3 gaps
- Lots of useful base packages installed
- Nicely configured i3 bar with useful widgets
  - Update manager
  - Network manager
  - Clipboard manager
  - Sound control
- Conky running on deskop
- Sane default dotfiles
  - Cool PS1 prompt
  - Nice i3 config that's well integrated with OS
- Comes with BMenu - a CLI system preferences interface, which works well.
- Cohesive system theme
- Comes with a screen locker
- Media keys work
- Camera works

**The bad**

- Everything is tiny from high DPI screen
- Sound doesn't work
- Videos don't play in full screen in firefox/chrome
- Emacs feels laggy (well, laggier than usual)
- Closing the lid freezes the system
- Mic doesn't work

**Fixes**

Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to do some serious fidding to
get [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)#Microphone][the mic to work]].  I'm just going to think of this as a security
feature.  (EDIT: mic fix
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=249900)

I made a few changes in ~/.Xresources~ to fix scaling issues.

Scale the DPI up: ~Xft.dpi: 140~

Make terminal font size bigger: ~URxvt.font:
xft:TerminessTTFNerdFontMono:pixelsize=23~

Installing pulse audio ~$ install_pulse~ fixes audio, but adjusting it
via the applet on the i3 bar doesn't work.  [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)#Volume_controls][Fix for volume controls]]
worked for me.

Here's a screenshot after the above fixes with everything else
default.

**Edit: ** I distro hopped a few times after that, and ended up on
Arch. Notes [[file:carbon-x1-arch.org][here]].
