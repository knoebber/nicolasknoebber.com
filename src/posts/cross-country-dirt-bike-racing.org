Recently I've been competing in [[http://ama-d36.org][d36]] cross country dirt bike races.
It's my favorite sport, and its been a blast to fully commit myself to
it. I used to race a bit as a kid, but this has been the first time
that I completed an entire season.

A race begins by everyone bringing their own machines to the starting
line. The lines are divided by engine size, age, and the riders skill.
A gun shot is fired for each line, and the pack takes off in a mad
dash. It's a free for all until you cross the line at the end. A race
usually takes between one and three hours.  During this time there are a
slew of possible problems:

+ Crashing
+ Other rider crashes into you
+ Flying of a cliff of no return
+ Mechanical problems
+ Can't see anything because goggles are muddy
+ Difficult terrain

While racing I've learned that being smooth and consistent is more
important than trying for raw speed. The first lap is for learning the
course, and the following laps are for optimizing. Finding the lines
that take less energy, remembering safe places to pass, and then being
able to execute the next time around is key.

I finished first in class three times this season. The first two from the
Sawmill Two Day Enduro and then Leoni Meadows.  Overall I finished
first place in points for C 250 4Stk, which I am definitely happy
about!
