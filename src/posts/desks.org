I like to document the desks that I write code at. It's interesting
to reflect on my environments from over the years. 

**Grinnell Iowa, 2014**

Here's my desk from my first year at Grinnell College. I was taking
intro to CS in Scheme, though I wasn't using this battlestation for
that. The highlight here is the custom poster that I printed and taped
together.  [[file:../../images/grinnell-first-year.jpg]]

**Grinnell Iowa, 2015**

This is my dorm room in my second year of college. I was taking a data
structures course in Java and learning highly applicable things like [[https://github.com/knoebber/csc207-skip-lists][how
to implement a skip list.]]

I was also dipping my toes into the world of Linux. I had installed
Mint on my desktop, though I did still keep a windows partition around
to feed my crippling video gaming addiction (see that red headset for
yelling at strangers over the internet?). I could SSH into our
departments Linux machines and finish lab work. Pretty slick!

This was my first real at home development setup. Someone gave me an
old low resolution monitor that I hooked up without hesitation. Two
monitors must be better then one, right? Now I could write code and
browse Reddit at the same time! Very productive.

Notice that I'm using a lounge chair painted with borrowed supplies
from the art department.  [[file:../../images/grinnell-second-year.jpg]]

**Mendocino California, 2017**

Fast forward to my first real software job. At this point I'm running
Arch Linux and writing SQL, PHP, JavaScript. I still have two
mismatched monitor sizes! If you look closely you can see I picked up
a few more novelty key caps since the last photo. Also pictured: my
misguided descent into everything dark mode.

**Ames Iowa, 2019**

I moved back to Iowa for some reason. I rented a spacious two bedroom
apartment with all utilities included for $650 a month. I didn't have
much furniture, but I was able to work with what I had.

**Ames Iowa, 2020**

New year, new apartment. I transitioned to a single monitor + standup
desk.  See if you can spot the 4 computers.

Bonus setup from the same apartment: working from the dining
table. Instead of dual monitors, I was experimenting with dual
laptops. I find that whenever I use more than one monitor I end up
using one screen for a distraction and one for code. So what's the
point in having them connected?

**Eugene Oregon, 2020**

I stayed at a house in Eugene for a few weeks and worked
remotely. This is maybe my most conventional desk yet! A civilized
MacBook + dongle setup. (the mug has a delicious late in it)

**Little River California, 2020**

Same setup as last time, different place. The copper cup is certainly
cool.  [[file:../../images/little-river-desk.jpg]]

**Comptche California, 2021**

I was still on the move using the same equipment. I did get a vertical
laptop holder to save space though. Nifty!

**Comptche California, 2021**

I finally moved to my own place after bouncing around between family
houses! I settled on a single monitor, my trusty Das Keyboard, an
adjustable height desk, light theme for my code editor, and a killer
view.  [[file:../../images/desk-at-sky-ranch.jpg]]
