[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(goddess)][Nut]] is the Egyptian sky goddess. She is often depicted as a nude woman
arching over the earth.

My Granny sculpted this piece for her masters of art thesis. She welded
her together with rebar and copper. The sculpture is built to burn - she
has participated in the original Burning Man festivals back when they
happened on the beaches of San Francisco.

We recently moved the goddess up the road. It was a bit sketchy - she
swung, flexed, and teetered while an excavator hung her by a
chain.

But she is as lithe as ever. We were able to stand her up again after
some work reinforcing her legs.  What a beauty!
