#+title: About Me
#+date: <2018-07-07 Sat>

Hi! I'm a software engineer who is interested in a whole lot of
stuff. I grew up in Mendocino, a small town on the coast of Northern
California.  I graduated from [[https://grinnell.edu][Grinnell College]] in 2017.

Outside of computers I enjoy long distance running, racing, writing,
reading, and playing games.

In general I am open to most things, and try to take any idea into
consideration.  So if you want to connect with me, work with me, or
share any kind of idea, please email me!  knoebber@gmail.com
