#+title: About Me
#+date: <2018-07-07 Sat>

Hi! I grew up and currently live in Mendocino, a small town on the coast of Northern
California.  I graduated from [[https://grinnell.edu][Grinnell College]] in 2017.

I enjoy programming, long distance running, writing, playing games,
cats, cooking, off grid living, gardening, and lots more!

In general I am open to most things, and try to take any idea into
consideration.  So if you want to connect with me, work with me, or
share any kind of idea, please email me!  knoebber@gmail.com
